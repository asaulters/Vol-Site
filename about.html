          VolSite(think of name) was created to benefit both organizations and
          developers. We know that starting anything is hard, so we believe that
          everyone could use some help.
        </h2>
        <p class="about-aboutWUP">
          We have been in both situations. We have created organizations and
          nonprofits, scrounging up enough money to buy a $100 website off
          Fiverr and cold-called other businesses asking to work on their sites
          for free to try to get legitimate real-world client experience.<br /><br />
          What has this taught us?<br /><br />
          Neither of those are very exciting. They add just a little more
          difficulty to an already tough situation.<br /><br />
          Here, we don't believe you need any more on your plate. We believe
          that there is a way both sides of that coin can get what they want
          without all the extra. This is why VolSite (new name needed still) was
          created. We are here to connect new organizations to new developers
          willing to work together on projects to help each other.
