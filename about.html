        VolSite(think of name) was created to benefit both organizations and
        developers. We know that starting anything is hard, so we believe that
        everyone could use some help.
      </h2>
      <p class="about-aboutWUP">
        We have been in both situations. We have created organizations and
        nonprofits, scrounging up enough money to buy a $100 website off Fiverr
        and cold-called other businesses asking to work on their sites for free
        to try to get legitimate real-world client experience.<br /><br />
        What has this taught us?<br /><br />
        Neither of those are very exciting. They add just a little more
        difficulty to an already tough situation.<br /><br />
        Here, we don't believe you need any more on your plate. We believe that
        there is a way both sides of that coin can get what they want without
        all the extra. This is why VolSite (new name needed still) was created.
        We are here to connect new organizations to new developers willing to
        work together on projects to help each other.

          We know there is a lot on your plate already. We know the sometimes
          disheartening realization of spend all of your time on something only
          to not make a dent in your list of todos. Let us take a little of that
          burden away. Here we give you the ability to have developers contact
          you about your perfect website and create it for FREE. We know you've
          better things to do and think about than this. Let us help you with
          this small part of your dream.

          Let's be real, finding that first job is not the easiest thing to do.
          No matter how you learned to program, that first job is always a giant
          pain. We've all heard it, you need experience to get a job, yet you
          need that job to get experience. Let us take a little bit of the
          difficulty out of finding clients to volunteer for. Here you can
          search through job opportunities to find ones you are excited to help
          with. With each completed job, you will not only get real client work
          experience, but youâ€™ll also get things to put on your portfolio and
          reviews as well. Let us make this transition into programming a little
          easier for you.
